# ML-Model-for-Predicting-Complexity-Weights-from-Text-Descriptions
This project is a machine learning pipeline that reads a dataset of maintenance work orders, processes text descriptions and service types, and predicts the "Complexity-Weight" of each entry using a trained Random Forest Classifier.
